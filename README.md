# Belly Button Biodiversity (Deprecated)

An interactive data dashboard for exploring the various bacteria present on the human belly button. The app uses Plotly.js to display an interactive pie chart and bubble chart with a dropdown for each sample. The app was initially deployed to Heroku @ https://belly-button-diversity-v1.herokuapp.com/ however, this app is not getting ongoing support.
This project was based on Dan Fergus's and Sarah Council's *Belly Button Biodiversity*: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

*This project was for an assignment at Washington University's Data Analytics Boot Camp (2019)*

# Technologies Used
* Python (Flask)
* JavaScript (Plotly.js)
* HMTL/CSS (Bootstrap 3)
